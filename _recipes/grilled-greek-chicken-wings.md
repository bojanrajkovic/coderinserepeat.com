## Directions

Easy peasy. If your wings aren't already cut into drummets and flats, cut the wing tips off and cut the remaining wing into their respective parts. See the video for quick tip on cutting the wings. Put the wings in a mixing bowl and dress with extra virgin olive oil and fresh cracked black pepper. Grill your wings up! In a separate mixing bowl combine 6-8 tablespoons of olive oil. Zest and juice of one lemon, the salt, pepper to taste, onion powder, garlic powder, pick and chop the oregano, and a couple ounces of feta and whisk. Vigorously! Toss the wings in the sauce and cover them thoroughly. Platter the wings and pour the residual sauce over the top and serve.
