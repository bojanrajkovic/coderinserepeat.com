## Directions

To make the sauce, mix all the ingredients together, except for the spring onions. Set aside

Make the wonton filling by mixing all the ingredients together in a mixing bowl

To fold the wontons, lay one wrapper flat in your left hand (if you are right handed), then add 1 tsp of the filling in the centre. Moisten your finger with a little water, then moisten the edges of the wrapper and fold in half to form a triangle. Make sure they are sealed well

Bring the two corners together into the centre to form a ‘water caltrop’ shape. Set them aside on a floured plate as you're making them

Cook the wontons in gently boiling water in batches of no more than 5–6, for 4 minutes. Serve in the sauce, garnished with the spring onion
