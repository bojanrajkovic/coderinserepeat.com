## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400ºF/200ºC.

2. Combine half of the seasoned salt, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder in a bowl and mix to combine.

3. Heat oil over medium heat in a large Dutch oven. Sprinkle seasoning mix over chicken thighs and cook, skin side down until the skin becomes slightly crispy (approximately 8-10 minutes). Flip the chicken thighs over to cook the other side (3 minutes), then remove from pan.

6. Cover with lid and bake for 35-40 minutes.

7. Remove from oven, cool for 10 minutes, and serve.

8. Enjoy!
