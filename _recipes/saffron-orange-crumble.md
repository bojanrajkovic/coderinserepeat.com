## Directions

Peel the oranges. Discard the peels and slice the oranges into bean-sized pieces. Add these directly to an oven-safe 12-inch skillet.

Add 240 grams of granulated sugar, cornstarch and lemon juice to the oranges. Stir to combine and let this sit while the oven preheats.

Grind the saffron threads using a mortar and pestle. Add the ice cube to the saffron powder and let it melt while the oven preheats.

Set a rack to the center of the oven and preheat it to 400°F.

In a food processor, add the flour, 110 grams of granulated sugar and butter for the crumble topping. Add the cardamom, cinnamon and salt and process until a crumbly dough forms. This may take some time, but it will get there!

Transfer the dough to a bowl and add the oats. Mix this together with your hands, letting the dough crumble into big pieces and making sure all the oats are evenly dispersed. Add this to the fridge to chill while the oven finishes heating.

When the oven is ready, drizzle the saffron water into the oranges. Take the crumble topping and press it into flat, disk-like pieces. Dot this over the oranges (see blog photo for reference).

Bake the crumble for 30 minutes at 400°F. Then lower the temperature to 375°F and continue to bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the crumble is deep golden and the orange filling is bubbling and thickened.

Remove the crumble, let it cool for 10 minutes (this will also let it thicken more) and scoop and serve with vanilla ice cream.
