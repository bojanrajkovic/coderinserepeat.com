## Directions

1. Rub the brisket all over with the mustard and thyme, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for two hours to overnight.

2. Season the beef liberally with salt and pepper. Heat the olive oil over medium-heat in a Dutch oven. When the oil shimmers, brown the meat on all sides: this should take about 12 minutes.

3. Set the meat aside, and add the onions to the pan. You may need to add an additional tablespoon of olive oil if the pan is too dry. Sauté just until slightly softened, about 1 minute. Deglaze with the Cognac, scraping up all the brown bits from the bottom of the pan.

4. Place the brisket back in the pot, along with the red wine and beef broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover the pot, and simmer for 3 hours.

5. After 3 hours, set the meat aside to rest. Boil the liquid in the Dutch oven vigorously until 4 cups remains. Lift out the garlic cloves, and squeeze the contents back into the pan. Pour the liquid, onions, and garlic into the food processor.

6. Mash together the butter and flour until well combined, and add along with the two mustards to the food processor. Whiz until smooth.

7. Cut the twine off the brisket, and slice into thin slices. Serve with the mustard gravy.
