## Directions

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Peel and grate about 1 inch of ginger. Mince the clove of garlic. Combine both in a bowl with the brown sugar, soy sauce and sesame oil. Stir it up until the sugar dissolves and you have a thick, sticky mixture.

Cut the salmon into three ounce portions (doesn’t have to be exact). Prepare a baking sheet with foil for easy clean up. If your salmon still has the skin attached, you do not need to spray the foil with non-stick spray. If there is no skin, give it some non-stick spray so that half of the salmon doesn’t get stuck to the foil.

Slather the salmon with the brown sugar and ginger mixture, trying to keep as much on top as possible. Bake the salmon for 20-25 minutes or until the sugar mixture on top is golden brown. Serve immediately.
