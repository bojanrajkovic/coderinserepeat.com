## Directions

**Marinating the Chicken**

In a bowl, combine buttermilk, Taco Seasoning, and egg whites. Add the chicken breasts to the mixture, ensuring they are fully coated. Add thinly sliced Thai chili peppers for extra spice. Cover and refrigerate overnight, allowing the flavors to meld.

**Preparing the Dry Batter**

In a shallow dish, mix together potato starch, corn starch, rice flour, and Taco Seasoning. Put some wet batter dripping and mix it in.

**Coat Chicken in Dry Batter**

Remove the marinated chicken from the fridge. Dredge each chicken breast in the dry batter, ensuring they are fully coated. After putting chicken in dry batter, let it rest for 10 minutes so the dry batter can get absorbed.

**Frying the Chicken**

Carefully place the coated chicken into the hot oil and fry at 315 degrees F until golden brown and crispy. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oil and place it on a wire rack to drain excess oil.

**Making the Honey Buffalo Sauce**

In a small saucepan, melt butter over low heat. Add honey and hot sauce to the melted butter. Stir gently until well combined, making sure not to let the mixture come to a boil. Let the sauce simmer on low heat for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.

**Coating the Chicken**

Once the sauce is ready, carefully coat each fried chicken tender with the honey buffalo sauce. Ensure each piece is evenly coated with the sauce.

**Serve and Enjoy**

Serve immediately and enjoy the crispy, flavorful Honey Buffalo Chicken Tenders!
## Notes

Adjust the amount of hot sauce according to your preferred level of spiciness. Enjoy your delicious homemade crispy chicken tenders with a sweet and spicy kick!
