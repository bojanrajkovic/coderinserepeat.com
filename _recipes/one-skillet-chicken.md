## Directions

Season the chicken with all spices and brown on both sides in avocado oil, about 4 minutes per side.

Remove the chicken from the pan and add onion and garlic. Sautee until translucent and add mushroom and spinach.

Sautee until spinach is wilted. Add couscous, chicken broth (you can deglaze the pan with a bit of white wine as well), and add the chicken back. Mix thoroughly, remove from heat, and cover for 10 minutes.
