## Directions

Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.

Mix together 1/2 ounce of the panko with 1 ounce of the Parmesan in a small bowl. Set aside.

Combine the chicken, egg, 1 tablespoon of the herb oil, the remaining 2.5 ounces panko, the remaining 3 ounces Parmesan, basil, garlic powder, parsley, oregano and salt in a large bowl. Gently combine using your hands until just incorporated, try not to over work the meat.

Divide the meatball mixture into 28 golf ball sized rounds (1 ounce each) and roll them in the panko mixture.

Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon herb oil over medium heat in a 12-inch oven safe skillet. Brown the meatballs in the herb oil, about 30 seconds on each side, working in batches if needed to avoid crowding the pan. Remove the browned meatballs from the pan and make the Weeknight Spaghetti Sauce beginning with step 1, but without cooking the spaghetti.

Add the meatballs back to the pan, cover with the grated mozzarella and bake until the meatballs are cooked through, about 10 minutes, and the cheese is melted. Serve over cooked pasta or on top of crispy bread.
