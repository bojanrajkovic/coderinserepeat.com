## Directions

**Cake**

Separate eggs and beat whites with salt until stiff but not dry.

Beat in 1 cup confectioner's sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time.

Fold in cocoa.

Beat yolks until thick and lemon-colored, then fold them into the cocoa mixture and add vanilla.

Spread into a 15x10x1 baking sheet lined with wax paper and greased, bake about 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Turn out onto towel sprinkled with confectioner's sugar and gently peel paper.

Cool and cut crosswise into quarters, then put layers together with whipped cream.

Spread with glaze and sprinkle with almonds, then chill and slice.

**Glaze**

In a double boiler, melt 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp baking chocolate, then remove from water.

Add 1/2 cup sifted confectioner's sugar, 2 tbsp boiling water, dash of salt, and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Beat until smooth and glossy.
