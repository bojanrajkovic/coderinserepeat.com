## Directions

Smoke the heavy cream in a glass bowl at 200 degrees for about 90 minutes. You can go longer for more smoke influence, but the key is to keep the cream from boiling (212 degrees Fahrenheit), if you keep your heat at or just below 200, you avoid the temperature of the cream from boiling.

Let cool to room temperature, then transfer into refrigerator to get a nice chill (about 1 hour).

When you churn, make sure the cream comes straight from the fridge and place in a cold mixing bowl (we put our metal mixing bowl in the freezer for about 5 minutes to get cold).

Place cream in mixer and turn on med-high. After a few minutes the cream should turn to whipped cream. Keep going. Eventually the solids and liquids will separate, and keep mixing until you know you’ve extracted as much of the solids. This can take anywhere from 10-15 minutes (or longer), but for us it usually starts to come together around the 10 minute mark.

Then rinse the solids in cold water (or an ice bath) to get rid of any remaining buttermilk and help it last longer in the refrigerator.

Roll the butter into the form you want (we like to shape it into a roll similar to a regular stick of butter using plastic wrap to help shape it) and keep cold until service.
## Notes

To salt or not to salt?

Feel free to add a bit of salt (about a teaspoon or less) to either your cream mixture before it’s whipped. Or you can do what we did. Add it to the butter after it’s been rinsed, but before rolling it into a stick. This will help the flavor of the butter to pop. Totally optional though!
