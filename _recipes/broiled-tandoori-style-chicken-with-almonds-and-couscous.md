## Directions

1. In a mixing bowl, stir together yogurt, 1 ounce (30ml) lemon juice, and tandoori spices. Season with salt. In a plastic zipper-top bag, combine chicken and yogurt mixture and mix thoroughly to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 8 hours.

2. Turn on broiler and set oven rack about 6 inches from broiler element. In a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet, toast the almonds under the broiler until slightly browned, about 2 minutes (check frequently as broilers can vary considerably). Remove almonds from the pan and set them aside.

3. Scrape chicken and yogurt marinade into the same skillet. Broil, turning once, until chicken is browned on both sides and just cooked through, about 6 minutes per side (again, check frequently as broilers vary). Using a slotted spoon, remove chicken pieces from the skillet and set aside in a warm place.

4. Scrape yogurt mixture from the skillet into a heatproof measuring cup. If needed, stir in enough water to bring the total volume up to 1 cup. Return 1 cup of the yogurt mixture to the skillet and broil until boiling, about 2 minutes.

5. Add the couscous to the skillet, scatter dates on top and cover skillet to allow couscous to steam in the hot liquid for 5 minutes. Uncover. Either directly in the skillet or in a serving bowl, toss couscous with half the toasted almonds, half the parsley, and the remaining lemon juice. Top with the chicken, garnish with the remaining almonds and parsley, and serve.
