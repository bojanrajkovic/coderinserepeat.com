## Directions

Remove the skin and bones from the fish.

In a food processor, add cream cheese, mayonnaise, lemon juice and zest, Worcestershire sauce, smoked paprika and blend until smooth.

Add fish, finely chopped red onion and freshly chopped dill and pulse until combined. You want it to stay a little chunky or make it smooth if you prefer that consistency.

Remove to a bowl, top with a sprinkle of smoked paprika and dill fronds. Serve with veggies, crackers or toasted baguette.
## Notes

To Store: Store the leftover dip in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week.
