## Directions

Preheat the oven to 220ºC/gas mark 7. Season the pollock with salt and pepper on both sides and lay skin-side down on a well-oiled baking tray

Put the breadcrumbs, cheese, parsley, dill and garlic into a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the melted butter and mix well with a fork. Divide the mixture between the fillets and press on top of each piece in a thick, even layer

Drizzle over a little olive oil and bake for 10—12 minutes (8 minutes per inch of fish thickness) or until the crust is crisp and lightly golden and the fish is cooked through

Lift onto warm plates and serve
