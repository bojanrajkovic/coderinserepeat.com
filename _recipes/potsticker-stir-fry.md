## Directions

In a 12-inch (or larger) skillet over medium heat, melt the ghee. Once it’s hot, toss in the carrots, shallots, and mushrooms.

Add a sprinkle of salt, and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes or until the shallots are soft and the ’shrooms are pliable.

Toss in the garlic and ginger, and stir for 30 seconds or until fragrant.

Add the pork along with another sprinkle of salt, and break up the meat with a spatula or wooden spoon.

Crank up the heat to medium-high, and cook for about 5 minutes or until the pork is no longer pink.

Transfer the cooked pork with a slotted spoon to another platter. Leave the cooking liquid in the pan.

Throw the cabbage into the pan with another sprinkle of salt, and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes or until wilted.

Lower the heat to medium, and add the ground pork back into the skillet.

Stir to combine.

Season with coconut aminos, rice vinegar, and fish sauce. Taste and adjust with more seasoning if needed.

Remove the skillet from the heat. Finish with a drizzle of sesame oil and a generous sprinkle of scallions. Serve and eat!

## Notes

Feel free to use ground turkey or chicken in place of the pork. Don't use the super lean stuff, though!

You can use ¼ to ½ cup All-Purpose Stir-Fry Sauce in place of the seasoning to make this dish even faster!
