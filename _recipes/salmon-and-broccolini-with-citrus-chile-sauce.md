## Directions

Finely chop jalapeños and garlic on a cutting board; sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Crush with the side of a chef’s knife until broken down into a coarse mash. (You can also purée in a food processor or mash with a mortar and pestle if you prefer.) Transfer to a small bowl and add grapefruit zest, honey, and 2 Tbsp. oil; toss to combine. Let green chile kosho sit until ready to use.

Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add broccolini and cook, tossing occasionally, until charred in spots and crisp-tender, 5–6 minutes. Transfer to a plate.

Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in skillet over medium. Season salmon with salt and cook, skin side down, until skin is browned and crisp, 6–7 minutes. Turn and cook on flesh side just until cooked through, about 1 minute.

Arrange broccolini and endive on a platter; season with salt. Arrange salmon over. Stir grapefruit juice and vinegar into dressing. Drizzle dressing over salmon, then top with sesame seeds.
