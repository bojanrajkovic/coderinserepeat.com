## Directions

Sizzle the Chicken

Start by heating a large frying pan over a medium flame. Once hot, add a tablespoon of oil and sear the chicken breasts until browned and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside on a plate.

Then add the crushed garlic and dried Italian herbs to the pan and cook for a minute, stirring constantly. Pour in the chicken stock and heavy cream and stir until the sauce is smooth and bubbly. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and the uncooked gnocchi to the same pan and cook until they are done.

Combine and Simmer

Then add spinach to the pan and cook until the spinach wilts. Finally, add the cooked chicken breasts back to the pan, add parmesan cheese and cook everything together for a few more minutes until the sauce has thickened and the chicken is heated through.

## Notes

You can use any kind of chicken for this recipe, for example chicken thighs or chicken legs, but be sure to adjust the cooking time accordingly.

If you want to make this recipe vegetarian, you can omit the chicken and use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.

The type of broth, and even the brand you use for the dish, will affect the saltiness of the final dish. Therefore, if the broth you are using is saltier, dilute it 1:1 with water. You can then always add salt to the final dish to taste.

Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in the microwave or on the stove with a little broth or cream to soften the sauce.
