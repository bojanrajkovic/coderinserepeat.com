## Directions

Slice chicken breasts and thighs into strips and place into your instant pot.

In a small bowl combine all of spices (cumin â€“ cinnamon).

Pour the spice mix over the chicken with a pinch of salt and some pepper.

Mix it all together so the spices evenly coat the chicken. Add chicken broth to the pot and secure the lid.

Place it on the poultry setting and get the time to 15 minutes.

Once the time is up let it depressurize on its own for 10 minutes then turn the steam release to venting until all the pressure is released.

Serve with veggies or on sweet potato toast drizzled with tahini sauce.
## Notes

If making in a slow cooker, follow the same instructions and cook on low for 4 hours.
