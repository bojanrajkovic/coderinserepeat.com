## Directions

Remove from the heat and whisk in ⅓ cup EVOO.

FOR THE AHI TUNA BURGERS:

With a sharp knife cut the tuna meat into 1-inch pieces. Add them to the food processor, drizzle the sesame oil over the tuna and pulse 4-6 times, be sure to not over-process the meat.

Add the tuna and the rest of the burger ingredients to a large mixing bowl. Mix all the ingredients together.

Form 5 equally-sized tuna patties and chill them for 20 minutes in the refrigerator.

Pre-heat grill to 400 degrees.

Spray grill grates with grill spray, high heat cooking spray, or brush them with oil.

Spray a good coating of cooking spray on the tuna burgers and place them on the grill. Turn the heat down on the grill and try to keep it around 350 degrees for the rest of the cooking process. (If your grill has some spots that get really hot – avoid those areas to prevent the burgers from burning.)

Close the grill lid and cook the burgers for 3 to 31/2 minutes.

Spray the sides of the patties that are facing up with cooking spray, then flip them over and cook for another 3 to 31/2 minutes. *See cooking notes below

Allow them to rest for 5 minutes then serve on burger buns with slaw and sriracha aioli

ALTERNATIVE STOVETOP COOKING METHOD:

Heat canola or high-heat cooking oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat.

Cook the tuna burgers in batches until nicely browned on both sides, about 3 minutes per side.

Watch them closely, because they will cook quickly and you don’t want them to burn or dry out.

FOR THE ASIAN SLAW:

Add the bag of slaw mix, green onions, jalapeno, carrots, and cilantro to a large mixing bowl and set aside.

Add the rice vinegar, Asian chili garlic sauce (either Sriracha or Asian Chili Garlic Sauce), honey, Dijon mustard, garlic cloves minced, sesame oil and soy sauce (or tamari for Gluten free option) to a sauce pan over medium-high heat. Bring it to a simmer, stirring occasionally for 2-3 minutes.

Remove from the heat and whisk in the olive oil until it becomes a smooth sauce.

Pour the sauce over the slaw mixture and toss until combined.
## Notes

If the patties are sticking to the grill you can try a few different things to get them to release: either turn the heat up on high on grill for 15-30 seconds to get them to release, or use a metal spatula to gently work the patties loose.

If some of the tuna meat sticks to the grill grates, either clean the grate off and spray it again with cooking spray before cooking the other side of the burgers in that spot, or just cook the patties on another spot on the grill - but be sure to spray it with grill spray first.
