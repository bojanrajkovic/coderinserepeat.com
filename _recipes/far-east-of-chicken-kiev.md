## Directions

Compound Butter

Heat skillet to medium high and add sesame oil, onions, red pepper, and peanuts. Sautee for 5 minutes. Set aside.

In food processor add all of the ingredients for the first stage of this recipe, minus the sauteed ingredients. Combine until smooth. Add the sauteed ingredients and pulse, keeping some of the texture.

Place in plastic wrap and roll into a log, twisting the edges of the wrap. Refrigerate for an hour.

Chicken Preparation

Lay a chicken breast between 2 pieces of plastic wrap or 2 large resealable plastic bags; pound to 1/4 inch thick with a heavy skillet or mallet. Transfer to a clean piece of plastic wrap and season with salt and pepper. Put a piece of compound butter in the center of the chicken; using the plastic wrap as an aid, tightly roll up the chicken starting at a long side, tucking in the short sides as you go. Tightly wrap the chicken roll in plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining chicken and butter. Chill for 90 minutes.

Set up your breading station with three bowls: 1. Four 2. Beaten eggs, 3. Panko plus curry powder Coat each breast in the flour, then the egg, and then the bread crumbs. Set aside. Heat oven to 350 degrees.

Heat sesame oil and butter in large skillet to medium high and add the chicken breasts, browning on all four sides.

Place on baking sheet and bake for 18 minutes. Remove from oven and garnish with cilantro and lime. Serve with jasmine rice.
