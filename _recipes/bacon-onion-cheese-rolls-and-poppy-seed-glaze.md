## Directions

1. Warm 180ml (3/4 cup) of milk slightly and mix it in a medium-sized bowl with the dry yeast and 1 tablespoon of honey. Let it stand for 6 minutes until the yeast has formed bubbles.
2. Add the egg, 3 tablespoons of soft butter, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the milk-yeast mixture and whisk together.
3. Gradually add 1/2 cup of flour six times, mixing each time before adding the next 1/2 cup until all the flour is incorporated. When the dough is firm enough, transfer it to a clean work surface and knead with the remaining flour until it becomes smooth, elastic, and soft. This could take around 10 minutes. You can also do this with a stand mixer.
4. Rub a large bowl with a little olive oil and place the dough ball in it. Then, lightly coat the dough ball with olive oil. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let it rest in a warm place (room temperature) for an hour. By this time, the dough should have doubled in volume.
5. Meanwhile, peel the onions, cut them into half-moons, and caramelize them in a large pan with a tablespoon of butter and a pinch of salt over low to medium heat. This takes about 30-40 minutes, depending on the desired color. Finish by deglazing with a splash of white wine and let it reduce briefly, so the fond dissolves and adds flavor. The wine can also be replaced with stock.
6. Remove the onions from the pan and set aside in a bowl. Then, without adding extra fat, fry the bacon in the pan until crispy. Add fresh or dried thyme, cayenne pepper, and honey, and let everything caramelize over medium heat, then deglaze with a splash of white wine (or stock). Let it boil and set aside.
7. Grease a baking dish with butter and set aside. Preheat the oven to 190°C (375°F).
8. Dust a clean work surface with some flour and place the dough on it. Dust the dough with a little flour and roll it out to approximately 30×40 cm using a rolling pin. Distribute half of the cheese evenly over the dough, followed by the caramelized onions and honey bacon. Finish with the remaining cheese. Roll the dough tightly from the bottom up. Cut the long roll into 12 equal pieces and place them in the greased baking dish with the cut side up. Cover the dish again with a towel and let it rest for another 30 minutes in a warm place.
9. Bake in the oven for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.
10. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, mix together 2 tablespoons of melted butter, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of poppy seeds, 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, and 1 teaspoon of Dijon mustard.
11. After baking for 30 minutes, evenly brush the rolls with the glaze and bake for another 5 minutes. Be careful not to let them get too dark.
12. Remove the baking dish from the oven, let it cool for 15 minutes, and serve.
