## Directions

Marinate the chicken:

In a large mixing bowl, add all the ingredients except the chicken (hoisin sauce, sugar, soy sauce, rice wine, bean curd, red yeast rice or food coloring, garlic powder, and five spice powder). Mix everything together and make sure to mash up the fermented bean curd well.

From the char siu marinade, reserve about 2 to 3 tablespoons of marinade for brushing. Cover and refrigerate until needed.

To the remaining marinade, add the skinless, boneless chicken thighs and mix well until the thighs are evenly and well coated with the marinade. Cover and allow the chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour but best overnight in the fridge.

Air frying method:

Line the bottom of the air fryer basket with a sheet of aluminum foil and arrange the marinated chicken in the basket in one even layer to promote even cooking. Avoid overlapping and overcrowding and cook in batches if needed. Optionally, save the leftover marinade for brushing.

*Also make sure to allow the excess marinade to drip off so that there's not a pool of marinade in the air fryer basket.*

Air fry each batch of chicken at 400°F for 10 minutes. Mid way through cooking, flip the chicken and optionally brush on some leftover marinade to keep the chicken moist.

After air frying for 10 minutes, flip the chicken once again and brush on the reserved marinade (from the very beggining). Make sure to use a clean brush. Air fry the chicken for another 2 to 5 minutes, or until a desired amount of char develops on the chicken.

Remove the char siu chicken from the air fryer and allow it to rest for 3 to 5 minutes before cutting. Repeat with remaining marinated chicken if needed.

Oven method:

Preheat the oven to 450°F, with the baking rack positioned at the middle of the oven. Also prepare a sheet pan lined with aluminum foil and a roasting rack.

Place the marinated chicken on the roasting rack, making sure to allow excess marinade to drip off and avoid overlapping and overcrowding. Reserve the leftover marinade for optional brushing.

Roast the marinated chicken for about 15 minutes. Mid way through cooking, flip and optionally brush on some leftover marinade to help keep the chicken juicy.

After 15 minutes, flip the chicken again and use a clean brush to bush on the reserved char siu marinade from the beginning. Place the chicken back into the oven and broil on high for 2-3 minutes, or until your desired amount of char is achieved.

Remove the char siu chicken from the oven and allow it to rest for 3 to 5 minutes before cutting.

Serve:

If you have leftover reserved char siu marinade, brush it on the char siu chicken and enjoy over some rice and with some vegetables.
