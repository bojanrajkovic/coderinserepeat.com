## Directions

Heat cream in a microwave or in a small pot on the stove, then add the saffron. Set it aside for 2 hours to draw out the saffron color.

Season chicken generously with salt and pepper. Set the sauté setting on the electric pressure cooker to high. Add in oil; wait a few seconds and stir in the golden raisins. When they’re plump (it will only take a few seconds), transfer them with a slotted spoon to a small bowl.

Add almonds into the oil. Stir. Once they’re golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute, transfer them with the slotted spoon and to the bowl with the raisins.

Add cardamom pods and cinnamon stick. Brown chicken, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Transfer them as they’re finished to a bowl or plate. Repeat with remaining chicken.

Stir onions into the pot and cook until starting to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in ginger and garlic, and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in coriander and cumin. Add a few tablespoons of water and scrape up what you can from the bottom of the pot.

Return all the chicken pieces and their liquid to the pot. Stir in yogurt, 1 tablespoon at a time. Stir in 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, chile powder and 1/2 cup water.

Cover and cook at low pressure for 6 minutes, then release the pressure manually.

Remove the lid, then turn on the sauté function on low. Cover with the glass lid or loosely with the regular lid, and simmer gently to meld the flavors, 7 to 10 minutes.

Stir in garam masala and saffron cream; taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Serve garnished with the raisins and almonds.
