## Directions

Beat 12 eggs until well blended.

Next, beat in milk and garlic powder, mustard, 1 tsp salt & 1/2 tsp pepper. Set aside.

Layer potatoes and sprinkle 1/3 of the onions.

Next sprinkle 1/3 of the bacon.

Last but not least, top with 1 cup of cheese.

Repeat this layering 2 more times to have a total of 3 layers....ending with cheese.

Take your egg mixture and pour over layers.
## Notes

You can use frozen hash browns, just cook for 8-9 hours, instead of the 7-8.

You may also want to add an additional pinch of salt and pepper for each layer of hash browns you use.
