## Directions

**Maple Cookies**

Preheat the oven to 375F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

Slice 1 tablespoon of butter from the 1 cup of room temperature butter and place that tablespoon into a small dish. Place the rest of butter into the mixing bowl of a hand or stand mixer with the paddle attachment.

Measure out 1 cup of light brown sugar and remove 1 tablespoon. Place that tablespoon into the dish of 1 tablespoon of butter and add the remaining brown sugar to the large mixing bowl.

Now add the granulated sugar to the large mixing bowl and mix on medium-high speed until smooth and lightened in color (about 2 minutes of mixing).

Scrape down the bowl and add in the maple syrup, egg, and vanilla. Mix again on medium-high speed for about 1 minute.

Pour in the dry ingredients and mix to combine. Then use a rubber spatula to mix the dough by hand, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure everything is well combined.

**Spiced Maple Butter**

To the small dish with the 1 tablespoon of butter and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, add the rest of the spiced maple butter ingredients and stir to combine.

Plop small amounts of the butter throughout the cookie dough. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the dough to disperse the butter into ribbons. Careful not to over mix.

**Cinnamon Sugar**

Using a large 2 oz cookie scoop (or ¼ measuring cup) scoop the dough and roll in a small bowl of the cinnamon sugar.

Place 3-4 cookies on the large baking sheet and bake for 6 minutes.

After 6 minutes, open the oven door and drop the pan against the oven rack about 3 times. Continue to bake for another 2 minutes. After those 2 minutes, repeat the slamming process. Then bake for another 2 minutes, then slam again. Then bake for a final 2 minutes and drop the pan one final time for a total of 12 minutes baking.

Allow the cookies to cool and continue baking the rest of the batch. Once all the cookies have baked, make the icing.

**Maple Icing**

Whisk together the melted butter and maple syrup, followed by the powdered sugar. Pour the icing into a piping bag or a sandwich bag and snip off a very tiny corner.

Drizzle over the cooled cookies and enjoy!
