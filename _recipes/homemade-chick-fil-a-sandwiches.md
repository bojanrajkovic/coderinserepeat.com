## Directions

1. Dissolve 1/2 cup kosher salt (see notes!) and 1/4 cup sugar in 1 quart cold water. Place chicken breasts in brine, transfer to refrigerator, and brine for at least 6 hours, and up to overnight (see notes!).
2. Combine paprika, black pepper, cayenne, and MSG in a small bowl.
3. Whisk together milk and eggs in a medium bowl.
4. Combine flour, milk powder, baking powder, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, 2 tsp sugar, 2 tbsp spice mixture in a large bowl and whisk. Drizzle 3 tbsp milk/egg mixture into flour mixture and rub in with fingertips until the mixture is coarse, like wet sand.
5. Preheat oil to 350F in a deep-frying vessel (a large wok, Dutch oven, or deep-frier)
6. Remove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry. Season with spice mixture, then bread one cutlet at a time, first transferring into the milk mixture to coat, letting that drip off, and then moving to flour mixture, turning to coat, piling extra mixture on top of the cutlet, and pressing firmly to get as much mixture adhering to the meat. This is what will create the crispy crust. Lift the cutlet, shake off excess flour, and lower into hot oil. Repeat for all 4 pieces.
7. Cook, turning occasionally until golden brown and crisp, and chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate to remove excess oil.
8. Place 2 pickles on each bottom bun and a fried chicken cutlet on top. Close the buns, then cover and let steam for about 2 minutes. Serve immediately.
## Notes

Just like the real thing, this fried chicken is quite salty. If you would like a less salty sandwich, reduce brining time to 1hr, and use less salt in the breading. For the brine, if using Morton's kosher salt, reduce salt by 25%. If using regular table salt, reduce by 50%.
