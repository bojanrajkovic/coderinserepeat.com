Ginger: Not just a character on Gilligan's Island. Ginger has its own unique and intangible flavor, managing to be both zesty and sweet. In this meal, it combines perfectly with the kick of gochujang, pungent garlic, and sweet teriyaki, forming the perfect of flavor combination for the steak and peppers, like Batman and Robin. Had enough 60s TV references for one meal description? This meal comes together so easy, you'll just twitch your nose and it'll appear. (Ok, maybe not that easy; there's no Elizabeth Montgomery in your box.) Tip: Make quick work of mincing garlic by smashing the whole clove with the side of your chef's knife. Then rock the knife back and forth, keeping the tip steady by resting your other hand over the top.
            
## Directions

**Cook the Rice**

Bring a medium pot with rice and 1½ cup water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until tender, 18-20 minutes. Remove from burner. Set aside covered. While rice cooks, prepare ingredients.
 
**Prepare the Ingredients**

Stem, seed, remove ribs, and slice red bell pepper into ¼" strips. Trim and thinly slice green onions. Mince garlic. Separate steak strips into a single layer and pat dry. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
 
**Sear the Steak Strips**

Place a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat and add 2 tsp. olive oil. Add steak strips to hot pan and stir occasionally until no pink remains, 4-6 minutes. Transfer steak strips to a plate. Keep pan over medium-high heat.
 
**Cook the Peppers**

Add 1 tsp. olive oil, red bell pepper, and a pinch of salt to hot pan. Stir occasionally until tender but still crisp, 2-4 minutes.
 
**Finish the Dish**

Stir in green onions (reserve a pinch for garnish), ginger, and garlic. Cook until aromatic, 30-60 seconds. Add steak strips and any accumulated juices, teriyaki glaze, ¼ cup water, and half the gochujang. Stir occasionally until thoroughly combined, 1-2 minutes. Taste, and add remaining gochujang and a pinch of salt, if desired. Remove from burner. Plate dish as pictured on front of card, topping rice with steak-pepper mixture and garnishing with peanuts and remaining green onions. Bon appétit!
