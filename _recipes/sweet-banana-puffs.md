## Directions

Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Cut in butter
with a pastry blender. Add buttermilk; mix well
and knead. Roll out dough 1/4-inch thick on a
lightly floured surface. Cut with a round cookie
cutter. Mash bananas; add coconut and mix well.
Place a spoonful of this mixture in the center
of each round of dough. Fold over and seal the
edges, using a little water. Heat deep fat to 350
degrees and drop pastries into it carefully. Fry
until golden brown. Drain well. Serve hot or cold.
If desired, the pastries may be baked on a but-
tered baking sheet in a 400-degree oven for 20
minutes. Yield: 6 servings.
