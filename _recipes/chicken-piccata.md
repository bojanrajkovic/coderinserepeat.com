## Directions

Heat Instant Pot to Saute and add oil. Salt and pepper both sides of the chicken and add to hot Instant Pot. Brown chicken for about 4 minutes on each side and then remove to a plate.

Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly for about 1 minute or until fragrant.

Add broth, lemon juice, oregano, and basil and scrape any brown bits off the bottom of the Instant Pot. Return chicken to Instant Pot and sprinkle capers on top.

Put cover on (make sure vent is turned to “seal”). Set Instant Pot to Manual for 10 minutes.

Once done, quick release the pressure. Use an instant read thermometer and ensure chicken has an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

Serve chicken with sauce in pan.
