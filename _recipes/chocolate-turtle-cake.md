  Everyone has a favorite cake, a cake by which you judge all others. For us,
  that's the Chocolate Turtle Cake, a hometown bakery classic that we couldn't
  not share with you. It all starts with a Queen of Sheba chocolate cake, a
  bland of chocolate bits and almond flour made popular in this country by Julia
  Child. As for the turtle, we top the cake with chocolate fudge frosting,
  toasted pecans, and a caramel drizzle so good it might just become your
  standard.

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350F. Line sides and bottom of pan with parchment paper or cupcake liners. Create a double boiler--a glass bowl placed on top of a saucepan of boiling water will do. Be sure there is space for the water to create steam underneath the bowl.


2. Melt 1 cup chocolate, 6 tbsp oil, and coffee, in the double boiler on low heat until very smooth. Remove from heat. Stir in maple syrup, 1/2 cup almond milk, vanilla, and vinegar until combined.

3. In small bowl, whisk ground flaxseed and boiling water and set aside for 5 minutes. In large bowl, whisk flour and baking soda blends. Add wet ingredeients to dry ingredients and fold with spatula untl smooth. Pour better into cake pan and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until cake passes the toothpick test. Remove from oven and let sit in pan 30 minutes. Move to cooling rack.

4. Melt remainder of chocolate and almond milk in double boiler on very low heat until smooth. Remove from heat and whisk in oil. Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Whisk in arrowroot powder until thickened and fluffy and keep at room temperature.

5. Preheat oven to 350F. Toast pecans on parchment paper for 6-8 minutes. Set aside. Heat cream, sugar, and salt to a boil. Cook at a simmer for 8 minutes or so, stirring often. Remove from heat and cool in refrigerator.

6. Frost, top with pecans, and drizzle with caramel sauce. Serve and store at room temperature.
