## Directions

Cook orzo according to package instructions. Chop and prep all veggies.

When orzo is cooked al dente, drain the water and then pour cold water over the orzo to cool it off. Drain the water completely.

Add the orzo and all other ingredients into a large bowl (you can wait to add the honey until after tossing.) Toss the salad well. Add more olive oil if desired and adjust salt and pepper to taste.

Chill until ready to serve. Toss just before serving and add an extra drizzle of olive oil if desired. Refrigerate in a sealed container for about 5 days.
## Notes

While this Lemon Orzo Salad can be eaten freshly tossed, chilling for about 30 minutes will allow the flavors to meld and really soak in. If time allows, try to chill.

If the salad has been chilling for more than a few hours, add extra olive oil and toss to add back in the moisture that may have been absorbed. For best results, always toss just before serving.

Add some strips of grilled chicken over top for added protein and make this salad a full meal!
