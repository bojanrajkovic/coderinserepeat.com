## Directions

Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Add the dry ingredients (2 cups flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup chocolate chips) into a mixing bowl and give them a stir.

Blend the bananas and all the wet ingredients (3/4 cup plant-based milk, 3/4 cup maple syrup, 1/4 butter, extract) in a blender.

Add spinach and blend again until smooth and green (fill the blender with as much spinach as you can fit, blend, then add more spinach if needed).

Pour the green blended mixture into the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl.

Stir until well combined.

Pour into muffin tins that have been sprayed with a little oil or into cupcake liners.

Bake for 18-23 minutes depending on the size of your muffin. (Mini muffins are usually done in 18-20 minutes).
