## Directions

Add the ground sausage to a large skillet and cook over medium heat while stirring. Once the sausage is mostly cooked add the diced onion to cook.

When the onion is translucent and soft and sausage is cooked through add the minced garlic. Cook for an additional 30 seconds.

Add the tomato sauce and diced tomato to the skillet. Stir to combine.

Add seasonings and stir. Break the lasagna noodles over the skillet and add to the sauce. Press the noodles down as much as possible into the sauce. Cover the pan and allow to simmer over medium heat for about 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally.

Once the noodles are softened add in a cup of mozzarella cheese. Stir to combine.

Serve and top with additional mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and fresh parsley.

Enjoy!
