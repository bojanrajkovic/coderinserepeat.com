## Directions

Heat up a large pot or dutch oven with some cooking oil (I like to use avocado oil spray) and one hot add in the onions. Cook until onions have softened.

Add the ground beef and brown the meat crumbling it into small pieces until thoroughly cooked.

Add garlic, paprika, thyme, oregano, salt and pepper, and bay leaves and stir.

Add crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, water, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and maple syrup. Stir to combine and bring to a boil.

Stir in the cabbage, and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer with a closed lid for 15-20 minutes. Cabbage should be soft, and tender but still a little crispy.

Stir in the cooked brown fluffy rice (or regular rice, brown rice is healthier though and you won't feel the difference), stir to combine, and let heat through simmering for 3 minutes.

Remove from the heat. Discard the bay leaves.

Serve with freshly chopped parsley and sour cream.

We like to serve it with plenty of sour creams, fresh dill or parsley, and black ground pepper.

Traditionally this dish is not served with cheese, but it doesn't mean you can't add it here.

Top it up with grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese. Add it during the last 5 minutes of cooking time to get the cheese extra melty or serve in individual bowls.

Let it simmer enough for the flavors to blend nicely and cabbage soaks up all the sauce mixture.

FREEZING AND STORING INSTRUCTIONS

Store any cooled leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3-4 days.

To freeze, the same steps and for 2-3 months.

To reheat, thaw first if frozen and reheat in a pot over the stovetop. You may need to add some extra water or stock/broth to thin it out. I don’t recommend reheating this in the microwave as the cabbage will or may become too soggy.

Anyways, try to make it and consume it fresh or within 24 hours for the best flavor and texture.

## Notes

Lean meat - opt for a low-fat and leaner version as it will cook better and you won’t end up with lots of extra fat and liquid in the pot.
