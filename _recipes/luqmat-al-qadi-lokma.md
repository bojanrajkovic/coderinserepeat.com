## Directions

Leaven

Mix the flour, yeast, sugar, and water.

Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 20 minutes.

Dough

In the bowl of a stand mixer, mix the flour and cornstarch.

Dig a well in the center and add the leaven.

While kneading at low speed, gradually add water.

After incorporating the water, add salt and knead at medium speed for 5 minutes.

Cover the bowl with a cloth and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place for 1 hour.

Syrup

While the dough is rising, prepare the syrup.

Mix sugar, water, lemon juice, rose water and saffron.

Cook over medium heat for 10 minutes before turning off and let cool.

Frying

Heat a large volume of oil in a deep skillet to a temperature of 350 F (170°C).

Punch the dough and then, using a teaspoon, previously dipped in oil, take a little piece of dough, form a ball and add to cooking oil.

Fry the dough balls for a few minutes, stirring constantly with a skimmer or spoon, until golden brown.

Be sure to keep the temperature of the oil at 350 F (170°C).

Coating

Soak the hot luqmat el qadi directly into the cold syrup.

Allow to absorb and drain in a colander or on a wire rack if necessary.
