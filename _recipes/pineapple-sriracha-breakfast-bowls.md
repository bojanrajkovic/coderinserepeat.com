## Directions

Reheat the cooked rice in the microwave, then season with soy sauce, sriracha, and a splash of sesame oil.

Roughly chop the pineapple pieces and thinly slice the green onion. Stir them into the seasoned rice.

Fry the egg, seasoning it with salt and pepper, and leaving the yolk slightly runny. Top the seasoned rice bowl with the egg and enjoy.
