## Directions

Trim and soak your herbs and leave to drain a while. Wash and chop the spring onions, and then chop the herbs. (If using dried herbs, soak them for 15 minutes and then squeeze as much of the moisture out as possible).

Beat the eggs well, and then blend in the flour, baking powder, seasoning and any of your chosen "optional extras". Fry the herbs and spring onions in hot oil for around 5 minutes, turning constantly, and then pour the egg mixture on top. Cook on a lowish heat for around 15 minutes, and then either toss the omelette or pop the pan under a hot grill for about 3 minutes. Slide on to a plate, and then cut into wedges. Enjoy hot or cold.
