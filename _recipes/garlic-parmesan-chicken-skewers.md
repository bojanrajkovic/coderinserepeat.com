## Directions

Prep and Skewer Chicken

Before you start, make sure to soak your wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.

Start by combining your chicken seasoning mixture in a small bowl and set aside. Prep your chicken by cutting in 3" pieces. Place them in a large bowl or ziptop bag and toss in olive oil and the spices, coating well on all sides.

Pack the chicken onto each skewer, making sure they are tightly packed with no space in between to ensure maximum juiciness. If needed, snip the top few inches of the skewers to fit in the air fryer after the chicken is skewered.

Make the Garlic Parmesan Butter Sauce

Add the butter and garlic in a microwave-safe bowl and heat until partially melted. Add in red pepper flakes, hot sauce, parsley, and parmesan. Whisk together until combined. (If sauce separates, add 1-2 tablespoons of softened butter and stir to re-emulsify.)

Scoop out 1/3 of the sauce and use that for basting the par-cooked chicken. Reserve the remaining sauce for basting the cooked chicken so you don't cross contaminate. Be sure to wash your basting brush in between.

Cook The Chicken

Cook 2-3 skewers at a time. Place in an air fryer and cook at 400 degrees for 5 minutes. Remove and flip the skewers, baste with sauce, return to cook an additional 2 minutes at 400 degrees.

Flip them back, baste with more sauce and cook another 5-6 minutes or until the internal temp reaches 165 degrees. Total cook time of 12-14 minutes. This time will vary based on your air fryer.

Once they are finished cooking, hit them with a final pass of the garlic sauce (the clean reserved sauce) and sprinkle with some extra parmesan and serve.

Grill Preparation:

Preheat your grill to medium-high. Place the prepared skewers over direct heat and cook each side for 5-6 minutes each, basting with butter throughout the cooking process.

Remove from the grill and baste it one last time with the butter sauce and sprinkle with leftover parmesan.
## Notes

Oven Preparation:

Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Place chicken skewers on a rimmed baking sheet lined with foil and cook for 14 minutes, flipping half way through and basting with butter a few times throughout the baking process.

Switch the oven to broil and cook an additional 2 minutes so get the tops golden brown. Remove from the oven and baste it one last time with the butter sauce and sprinkle with leftover parmesan.
