## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325F. Line bottom and sides of loaf pan with parchment paper. Alternatively, you may coat the pan with oil.

2. In a large bowl, combine coconut sugar, maple syrup, coconut oil, and apple-sauce, and stir together until smooth. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, guar gum, baking soda blend, and cinammon blend.. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix until combined. Careful not to overstir, as this may create bubbles in the batter.

3. Pour bater into prepared loaf pan and bake for 45 minutes, or until cake passes the toothpick test. Remove and place pan on cooling rack for 15 minutes. Then remove cake from pan and continue to cool for 30 minutes or more.

4. While oven is still hot, place walnuts on a parchment-lined cookie sheet and bake for 6-8 minutes at 325F. Crush by hand or with food processor and set aside.

5. Heat all remaining topping ingredients on medium heat until boiling. Continue stirring while boiling for two full minutes. Remove from heat and place in freezer or refrigerator until pan is cooled and sauce has slightly thickened. Remove just before serving.

6. Top cake with fresh apple slices if desired. Sprinkle with crushed toasted walnuts and pour caramel glaze over top to your liking. Service sliced with a cup of hot tea or coffee.
