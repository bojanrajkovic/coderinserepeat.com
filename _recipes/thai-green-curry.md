## Directions

Press ‘Saute’ and stir in Green curry paste and 1/2 can of coconut milk until mixture is bubbly, about a minute or two.
Stir in coriander and cumin and cook for 30 seconds.
Press 'Cancel'.
Stir in chicken, remaining coconut milk, and chicken broth.
Close Instant Pot and make sure steam release handle is in the ‘Sealing’ position.
Cook on 'Manual' (or 'Pressure Cook') mode for 4 minutes.
Do a Quick Release of pressure and open the Instant Pot.
Add in fish sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, bell pepper, zucchini, onions, bamboo shoots, and lime leaves.
Press 'Saute' and cook until vegetables are crisp-tender, 3 to 5 minutes.  (Be sure not to overcook.  Vegetables will continue to cook in the residual heat.)
Taste and adjust with more fish sauce, brown sugar or lime juice.
Stir in the Thai basil leaves.
Serve with Instant Pot Jasmine Rice.
## Notes

Prep time does not include steps that are already accounted for in the ingredient list, e.g. chopped onions, minced garlic, diced chicken, etc.
Use a splatter screen if necessary, in the first step, to guard against coconut milk splatters.
You can choose to substitute the vegetables with your choice e.g. green beans, Thai eggplant, peas.
You can also increase the quantity of vegetables to suit your tastes.
My chicken was thinly sliced. If your pieces of chicken are larger, you'll need to add on a few more minutes of cooking or just do a natural release of pressure.
* Lime leaves are also referred to as k-lime, makrut or kaffir lime leaves.
