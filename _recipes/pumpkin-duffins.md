## Directions

Preheat oven to 350°F and prepare a muffin tin with baking Pam (loooove the baking Pam), or grease and flour.

In a bowl combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg.

Over medium heat melt butter. When it juuuust starts to brown, take it off the heat, add the pumpkin purée and fold together with a spatula. After a few minutes of folding/stirring the butter will start to absorb into the purée and the whole mixture takes on a shiny look. Add both of the sugars and stir to combine.

Add the egg and combine. Alternating wet and dry, add the flour mixture and the milk to the pumpkin mixture. Spoon into the cups and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the muffin tins spring back when pushed lightly. (If you're making mini duffins, check them after 10 minutes).

For the topping: While the duffins are cooking, brown the remaining 6 tablespoons of butter in a small sauté pan. When it smells nice and nutty, remove to a separate bowl, straining out any remaining solids if necessary. In a separate bowl, combine the remaining topping ingredients. When the duffins are done and cooled slightly, run a knife around them and pick them out of the trays. Give them a quick dunk in the browned butter and roll them around in the topping.
