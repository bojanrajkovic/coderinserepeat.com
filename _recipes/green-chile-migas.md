## Directions

Preheat the oven to 400ºF. Stack the tortillas and then cut them into six equal sized wedges. Place the tortilla wedges in a bowl and drizzle the cooking oil over top. Gently toss the tortillas until they are well coated in oil.

Spread the oil coated tortilla triangles out over a baking sheet in a single layer. Bake the tortillas for 8-10 minutes, stirring once half way through, or until they are golden brown and crispy. Leave the oven turned on.

While the tortillas are baking, prepare the other ingredients. Lightly whisk the eggs, drain the can of green chiles, measure the sour cream, and slice the green onions. Also gather 2 Tbsp butter and 2 oz. queso fresco or shredded Monterey jack cheese.

Add the butter to a large skillet and heat over medium, or just below medium. Allow the butter to melt, then swirl the skillet to coat the bottom and around the edges. Pour the eggs into the hot skillet and gently scramble the eggs until they are about 60% solid (if you want to skip the oven and cook it all on the stove top, cook the eggs until they are about 85-90% solid). Season the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper.

Take the eggs off the heat and spoon the green chiles over the surface. Add the sour cream in dollops all over the eggs. Add the baked tortilla chips and then gently fold them into the eggs so they are half covered beneath the eggs. Finally, crumble the queso fresco or sprinkle shredded Monterey jack over top.

Transfer the skillet to the oven (still set to 400ºF) and bake for 5-8 minutes, or until the eggs are set and the cheese is melted. If cooking entirely on the stove top, place a lid on the skillet and place it over medium heat until the egg are fully set and the cheese is melted.

Sprinkle sliced green onions over top just before serving.
