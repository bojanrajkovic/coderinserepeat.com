## Directions

Mix sage, thyme, brown sugar, salt, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes, black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika in a medium bowl. Add pork and work spice mixture into meat with your hands until it's very well blended.

Scoop out ¼-cupfuls of mixture and flatten into about ¼"-thick patties (they will plump slightly when cooled).

Griddle sausage over medium-high heat until browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook 2 minutes more.
