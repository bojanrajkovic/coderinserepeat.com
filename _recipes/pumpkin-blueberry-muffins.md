## Directions

Preheat the oven to 375°F.

In a large bowl whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices.

In another bowl, beat together the whole can of pumpkin with the eggs and vanilla.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry, alternating with splashes of the oil to help mix. The batter will be very very thick, this is to hold the blueberries!

Fold in the blueberries and portion into jumbo muffin tins, you want the batter to be almost to the top.

To make the crumble topping, uses your hands to work the chilled butter in with the brown sugar and flour, crumbling everything together until you have the texture of thick, chunky crumbles. Sprinkle this on top of the muffins.

Bake at 375°F for 35-45 minutes or until you can insert a toothpick and it comes out clean!

Serve warm.
