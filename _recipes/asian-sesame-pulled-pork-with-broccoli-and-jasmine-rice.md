## Directions

Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Toss broccoli with olive oil and a pinch of salt, and place alongside rice in a shallow baking dish.
 
Top rice evenly with pulled pork, breaking into small pieces. Drizzle on hoisin, then honey.
 
Bake uncovered until pork is deep brown and glazed, 15-20 minutes. Carefully remove from oven, drizzle broccoli with dressing, and sprinkle pork with sesame seeds.
## Notes

Adapted from a Home Chef "ready to cook" meal. Pulled pork can be made or bought ahead of time. It probably shouldn't be too saucy, though some barbecue sauce flavors may be complementary.
