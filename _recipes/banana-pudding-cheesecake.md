## Directions

Roasted Bananas

Preheat the oven to 400F and line a small baking sheet with foil.

Lay the sliced bananas on the pan, banana side up.

Sprinkle the bananas with the sugar and then turn them over so that the skins now face up.

Bake for 10 minutes, or until the skins are completely black and they’re leaking juices out the sides.

Let the bananas cool while we make the crust.

Nilla Wafer Crust

Change the oven temp to 350F.

Once the Nilla Wafers are ground in a food processor, blitz in the sugar, melted butter, and salt.

Then mix by hand with a spoon to make sure everything is evenly hydrated.

Grease the entire inside of a 9″ springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper.

Dump in the crust and press it into the bottom and up the sides.

Bake the crust for 10 minutes, then let it cool while we make the cheesecake batter.

Banana Cheesecake

Keep the oven temp at 350F. Position an oven rack at the bottom of the oven and another in the middle. Then place a large roasting pan on the bottom rack and start a medium pot of boiling water on the stove top. We will need these when we place the cheesecake in the oven.

In a large mixing bowl using a hand or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, mix the cream cheese on medium-low speed until smooth (about 30 seconds). Scrape down the bowl.

Peel back the skins on the roasted bananas and toss the soft bananas into the cream cheese. Mix again on medium-low speed until the bananas are broken up and evenly distributed.

Add in the sugar and cornstarch and mix on medium-slow speed until smooth.

Scrape down the bowl and mix in the sour cream and vanilla on low speed.

Finally, mix in the eggs one at a time on medium-low speed.

Use a rubber spatula to scrape the bowl and mix the batter by hand just to make sure everything is well combined. The batter may appear a bit lumpy, but that’s ok! Those are bits of roasted banana.

Pour the batter into the crust and spread it even.

Carefully pour the boiling water into the roast pan on the bottom rack of the oven. Moving quickly to try to keep as much steam in the oven as possible, place the cheesecake on the middle rack just above the roast pan and shut the oven door.

Bake for 50 minutes – 1 hour, or until the edges are well puffed, golden, and slightly cracked with a center that has a tight jiggle when the pan is nudged.

Shut off the oven and crack open the door with the cheesecake still inside. Let it rest inside the oven for 1 hour.

Then let the cheesecake sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

Banana Pudding Topping

In a mixing bowl, whisk together the vanilla pudding mix and milk. Whisk vigorously for about 5 minutes or until thickened into a soft pudding consistency.

Arrange the banana slices on top of the cheesecake in a single even layer.

Spread the pudding on top, completely covering the bananas.

Transfer the cheesecake to the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours, but preferably over night.

When you’re ready to serve, whip the heavy cream and 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar on high speed. Whip to soft peaks.

Remove the cheesecake from the pan and top with a mound of whipped cream and a handful of crushed Nilla Wafers.

Now slice and enjoy!
