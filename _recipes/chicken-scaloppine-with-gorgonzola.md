## Directions

Coat the chicken slices with flour.

Warm the extra virgin olive oil in a pan and sauté the chicken in it. Brown well on both sides.

Add Marsala and let the alcohol evaporate.

Add the heavy cream and chopped Gorgonzola and mix to dissolve the cheese.

Season with salt and pepper, cover and cook until the chicken is cooked through.

When ready, top with the crushed walnuts and chopped parsley and serve warm.
