  This classic fish preparation yields one of the prized seafood products coming
  from the pristine waters surrounding Scotland in the North Atlantic. The town
  of Findon in Scotland is the origin of this great product and the name of the
  preparation comes from the local pronunciation of the town and the fish used
  to make it (Findon is called Finnan and haddock are called Haddie). The key to
  the excellent product is of course to begin with excellent fish and then for
  the brining and smoking process to be performed in as controlled a process as
  possible. Cold smoking is key to creating this and this recipe is written in
  order to make a typical kitchen smoker set-up as cold as possible. Ideally a
  true cold smoker is used to make the highest quality finnan haddie.

## Directions

*For Making the Brine and Brining the Fish*

1. Combine the water, salt, sugar, bay leaves and black peppercorns in an
appropriate sized pot and bring mixture to a boil to dissolve the salt.
2. Once the brine has reached a boil turn the heat off and remove the brine from the
stove and allow it to cool completely by either setting it aside at room temperature until cool (will take at least a couple of hours) or cool in an ice bath to speed process
3. Once the brine has cooled to room temperature place the brine and fish together in a non reactive dish (plastic works well for this) that can hold both.
4. Place the fish and brine into the refrigerator and allow them to sit for 1.5 hours
5. Once the fish has been brined for 1.5 hours remove the fish from the brine and set
the fillets onto smoking racks.
6. Place the smoking racks into a refrigerator with the fillets and allow them to dry
and the formation of a pellicle for at least 3 hours and as long as overnight if needed.
  
7. Once the fillets have dried in the refrigerator and the pellicle has formed the fish is ready to be smoked

*For smoking the fish*

For Smoking The Haddock
1. Prepare the smoker for use by placing a few pieces of smoking wood (if using
chunks of wood or a handful of chipped wood if using that) into the smoker and
turn the smoker on low to get the wood smoking.
2. Place a container of ice into the smoker as well to help with keeping ghte smoker
cool as you smoke the fish.
3. Once the smoker is smoking turn the smoker off (the wood should continue to
burn once it is started) and add the fish and smoke for 30 minutes or until the
smoke starts to wane from the wood burning out.
4. Once the smoker begins to wane remove the fish from the smoker and place it
into the freezer to chill the fillets and prevent them from getting cooked during
this process.
5. Add a new batch of wood to the smoker once the fish has been removed and once
again what for it to begin smoking and replace the now partially melted or melted
ice with fresh ice in the bottom of the smoker.
6. Once the smoker is smoking well add the fish back to the smoker from the freezer
and smoke again for 30 minutes.
7. Once the fish has been smoked for 1 hour remove it from the smoker and set it
aside in the refrigerator until ready to use.
## Notes

Haddock fillets should be skin-on, about 1.25lb apiece. Size is important!

If haddock isn't available, good Atlantic cod can be substituted.
