name: Aviation
description: |
  Based on the original Aviation recipe, but with reduced gin and
  increased lemon and maraschino, to balance the cocktail a little
  bit away from the sometimes overpowering sourness of the original,
  which calls for 2 oz. gin. The creme de violette is genuinely
  important, and gives the cocktail its eye-catching color.
flavors:
  - Sweet
  - Herbal
servings: 1
proportions:
  - 1.25 oz. gin (dry, juniper-forward)
  - 0.75 oz. lemon juice
  - 0.5 oz. maraschino liqueuer
  - 0.5 oz. creme de violette
  - flamed lemon peel
substitutions:
  - Subtract 0.25 oz. gin, subtract 0.25 oz. creme de violette to match
