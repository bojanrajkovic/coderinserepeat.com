Once upon a time, I was going to be a scientist. These days, I try to keep up
with the field -- it's been occasionally useful during 2020's Coronavirus
pandemic.

I'm also a history buff, particularly around the Balkans, where I was born. I've
lived in the US since 1997, entirely in New England. Currently residing in the
Boston MSA.
