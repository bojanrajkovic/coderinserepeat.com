Director, Monitoring Engineering at SimpliSafe â€” my teams build the
infrastructure that delivers alarms to the monitoring center, and builds user
experiences relating to monitoring, both for customers and monitoring agents.

In the past, I've been an engineering manager at First Republic Bank, CareStack,
Microsoft (working on [Xamarin Workbooks][workbooks]), and infrastructure &
commerce operations lead at Xamarin. Once upon a time, I was going to be a
scientist. These days, I try to keep up with the field -- it's been occasionally
useful during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

I'm also a history buff, particularly around the Balkans, where I was born. I've
lived in the US since 1997, entirely in New England, and currently reside in the
Boston MSA.
