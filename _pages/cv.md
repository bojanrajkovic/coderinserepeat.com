## About Me

Broadly speaking, I'm T-shaped &mdash; I'm comfortable leading teams and
managing people, diving into code (writing, reviewing, debugging, optimization,
etc.), building infrastructure, working on engineering systems and culture,
building software development lifecycle policy, structuring out knowledge
management (ask me about why it's key to healthy organizations!), and designing
systems architectures. I'm a Git wizard, a comfortable and proficient technical
writer, and I love to teach and mentor.

I'm comfortable learning on the fly &mdash; I firmly believe that for most
engineers, the things you already know aren't important, but your curiosity and
learning/knowing how to learn are what will determine your success. I love
building organizations and finding efficiences and economies of scale and
structure that make collaboration easier; my teams are consistently
highly engaged with their work, deeply care about their customers and products,
and it shows in their outcomes.

If you're a startup, I also bring experience in the business of startups &mdash;
the team I led at Xamarin worked closely with finance, sales, and executive
teams to devise and build new approaches to collating and understanding business
data, and extract insights that correlated to how we built and shipped our
software.
