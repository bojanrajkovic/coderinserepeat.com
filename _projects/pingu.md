A fully managed PNG encoder written in C#, with an eye for speed as well as
implementation correctness (via pngcheck). Works pretty well for simple images
already, though is not quite as fast as I would like.

Someday, I will revisit this with the performance primitives introduced by .NET
Core 3-and-later.
