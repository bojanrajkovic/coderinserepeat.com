A full DNS client for .NET Core, including implementations of DNS-over-TLS and
DNS-over-HTTPS. Also includes a WIP DNS server. The idea behind Ward was that it
would eventually replace Pi-hole in my home setup.

Ward is mostly-dead as a concept (AdGuard Home/Pi-hole have sufficiently
improved), but the concept of a high-performance DNS library I think is still a
useful one.
