A library of C# implementations of useful types and tools from other languages,
currently mostly borrowing from Rust (`Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>`) and Kotlin
(`Let`, `Use`, and `Also`).

Oxide aims to keep the APIs that it introduces ergonomic&mdash;for example, the
Option and Result types do their best to integrate into C# pattern matching.
